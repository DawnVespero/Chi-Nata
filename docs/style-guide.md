# Chi-Nata Style Guide

Do you really want to contribute to the project but don’t know too much about MacOS 9's icons? Then you’re in luck! This document collects all our shared wisdom on what makes these icons’ design so recognizable.

## Perspective



## Drop Shadows

One of the best features of MacOS' icons is their physicality. They feel like little pins dropped onto your desktop, and the deep drop shadows are one of the major factors in this. They don't really trace the exact outline of the icon, so a generic, half-circle shadow across its width is generally preferable:

## Outline

Almost all MacOS 9 icons have a 1-pixel solid black outline drawn around them. This helps both to keep the outline distinct against a variety of backgrounds and contributed to its friendly, cartoony art style. The hard disk icon is a great example of this:
